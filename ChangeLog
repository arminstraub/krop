krop (0.4.13)  2017-07-22 -- Armin Straub

  + Added the command line option --go, which outputs a PDF using the choices
  from --autotrim, --rotate and --whichpages, without opening the krop GUI
  (thanks to Mirko Weihrauch for the idea).
  + Padding for auto trimming can be specified as in CSS using one to four
  values.  This option is now also available on the command line as
  --autotrim-padding.  (Thanks to Jonah Langlieb for providing sanity checks!)
  * Fix incorrect string handling when opening files from the command line
  using python3 (thanks to Giuliano Costantini for observing and fixing this).


krop (0.4.12)  2017-01-22 -- Armin Straub

  * Use CropBox instead of MediaBox when determining the region to be cropped
  (thanks to Tim Mueller for observing and fixing this).
  * Use a more proper Python package structure (thanks to Xavier Corredor
  Llano for advice).


krop (0.4.11)  2016-08-20 -- Armin Straub

  * Make krop compatible with both python2 and python3.


krop (0.4.10)  2016-05-29 -- Armin Straub

  * When cropping, all PDF page boxes (ArtBox, BleedBox, CropBox, MediaBox,
  TrimBox) are now adjusted.


krop (0.4.9)  2015-10-31 -- Armin Straub

  * Reading PDF files is less strict now.  As a consequence, krop doesn't give
  up cropping some files which resulted in an error before.
  * Fix a possible crash when starting krop.


krop (0.4.8)  2015-07-04 -- Armin Straub

  + More options are accessible via command line arguments.
  * Mouse cursor now changes when over selections and handles.
  * Improved visibility of selections.


krop (0.4.7)  2015-02-15 -- Armin Straub

  + Basic options are accessible as command line arguments (run krop with
  --help to see available options).
  * When pressing ctrl-c in the terminal, krop will shut down (not gracefully,
  though; only intended for when there is trouble).
  * Avoid hitting Python's recursion limit in the pyPdf library when working
  with certain large pdf files (thanks to Victor).


krop (0.4.6)  2014-05-24 -- Armin Straub

  + Added option to specify pages which require individual selections (thanks
  to Roger Krebs for the suggestion and for testing).
  * 'Trim Margins' automatically creates a region for the full page if no
  regions exist.
  * Reorganized options across tabs.
  + Added appdata file (thanks to Richard Hughes).


krop (0.4.5)  2014-02-01 -- Armin Straub

  * Load and write files with non-ascii characters in their filename.


krop (0.4.4)  2013-08-18 -- Armin Straub

  + If available use PyPDF2 in place of pyPdf.
  * Correctly crop PDFs which have orientation other than 'portrait' (thanks
  to Gaetano Pepe for sending sample PDFs and testing).
  * In case of more than one selection per page, cropping is much faster now
  and results in smaller files.
  * Delete old selections when opening a new file.


krop (0.4.3)  2013-08-10 -- Armin Straub

  * Fix a bug that prevented PDF files to be specified on the command line
  (thanks to roctheme for reporting).
  * Instead of no icon at all, use the system icon 'edit-cut' as application
  icon (thanks to roctheme for the suggestion).


krop (0.4.2)  2013-08-04 -- Armin Straub

  + Use PyKDE if available (though this is not really used yet).
  * If default icons are missing, use text instead.


krop (0.4.1)  2013-07-28 -- Armin Straub

  * Initial public release.
  + Several small bug fixes.

  + Added option to automatically trim selection (right-click a selection for
  this option).
  + Added support to subdivide selections into several pages in order to
  exactly fit the screen size of specific devices (with eReaders, such as my
  Nook, in mind).


krop (0.1.0)  2010-08-19 -- Armin Straub

  * Initial personal release.
