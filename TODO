Roadmap (ideas planned for one of the next releases)
+ Improve support for pikepdf, PyMuPDF and pypdf (e.g. preserve links)
+ Support QtPy, an abstraction layer for both PyQt and PySide (for Qt5 and Qt6)
+ Expose further Ghostscript features (like exporting to PDF 1.7)
+ Save and later reuse regions for cropping
+ Use parallel processing for certain tasks like cropping
+ Allow translations (once UI has stabilized)

Wishlist (ideas that are likely difficult or currently impractical)
+ Preserve meta data, table of contents and bookmarks when cropping
+ Option to overlay pages in order to improve making selections
