  + Fixed aspect ratios, like letter size, can be chosen for selections.
  + Selections (or a grid of selections) for the full page can now be created
  using the context menu or by pressing Insert (or Shift+Insert). Also
  introduced the command line option --grid to create a grid of selections on
  the initial page.
  + Auto trimming margins can now inspect all pages.
  + New option for whether to include pages without selections in the output.
  + Added the command line options --optimize (thanks to Ondrej Tichacek for
  suggesting this feature) and --exceptions.
  + Implemented several keyboard shortcuts including Shift+Arrow to move
  current selection and Delete to remove it.
  * Keep track of current selection and highlight it visually.
  * Don't fail on PDFs that are encrypted with an empty password.
  * Remember window geometry and fit in view setting.


krop (0.5.1)  2018-10-27 -- Armin Straub

  * Replace and extend the README file with a MarkDown version (thanks to
  Eduardo Montenegro for doing this).
  + Add a manpage.
  * Fix a Qt5 related bug when selecting filename for saving (thanks to
  Lin-Buo-Ren for reporting this).


krop (0.5.0)  2018-02-11 -- Armin Straub

  + Support PyQt5.
  + Use Ghostscript to optionally optimize the final PDF (thanks to Mathias
  Rav for the idea and code).


krop (0.4.13)  2017-07-22 -- Armin Straub

  + Added the command line option --go, which outputs a PDF using the choices
  from --autotrim, --rotate and --whichpages, without opening the krop GUI
  (thanks to Mirko Weihrauch for the idea).
  + Padding for auto trimming can be specified as in CSS using one to four
  values.  This option is now also available on the command line as
  --autotrim-padding.  (Thanks to Jonah Langlieb for providing sanity checks!)
  * Fix incorrect string handling when opening files from the command line
  using python3 (thanks to Giuliano Costantini for observing and fixing this).

  * Use CropBox instead of MediaBox when determining the region to be cropped
  (thanks to Tim Mueller for observing and fixing this).

  TrimBox) are now adjusted.

  though; only intended for when there is trouble).

  with certain large pdf files (thanks to Victor).

  + If available use PyPDF2 in place of pyPdf.

  and results in smaller files.

  * Fix a bug that prevented PDF files to be specified on the command line
  (thanks to roctheme for reporting).
