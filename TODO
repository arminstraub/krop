Roadmap (ideas planned for one of the next releases)
+ Allow translations (once UI has stabilized)
+ Support PySide in addition to PyQT
+ Support pikepdf in addition to or instead of pyPdf/PyPDF2
+ Expose further Ghostscript features (like exporting to PDF 1.7)
+ Save and later reuse regions for cropping

Wishlist (ideas that are likely difficult or currently impractical)
+ Preserve meta data, table of contents and bookmarks when cropping
+ Option to overlay pages in order to improve making selections
